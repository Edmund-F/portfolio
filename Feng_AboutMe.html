                <p class="card-title">Work. That is something that we all have to do one day in order to have a succesful life. But the real question is, what kind of work? Work that you enjoy? Work that pays well? It all depends on what you do, how you study, your grades, and your drive. For me, coding was the way I would go. While some people may say that coding isn't the best job there is, they may be right, but in the end, its merely a opinion of another person. Reasons for me to pursue this one goal is because coding, or comp. Sci. engineering benegits people in the future. With C.S engineering, we can pave the path for things that humanity has yet to figure out yet. Plans to achieve this one goal is actually quite basic. Studying hard and always move on, c.s is a hard subject, with many confusing twist and turns, but with enough information and the desire to finish, you can over come anything. Everyone is good at something, and all have a trait which sets them apart from some people. For me, traits I can say are hard working and preserverence. These 2 characstics are quite beneficial toward CS. coding takes quite a while to finish, and there is also the chance of the code not working in the first place, these 2 traits will take care of that problem quite efficiently. I am also adapatable when the situation arises, meaning that I will be able to handle problems which may come up, and on CS, you may never know what might suddenly pop out in front of you. Accomplishments in high school that i have aquired currently are my projects that we have finished. Projects that we finished are Scratch, MIT app inventor, and now Bootstrap. These 2 projects (achievements) are only the start of my current achievements.Through these projects, I have learned soemthing about myself, my preserverence to keep on working. On the MIT app inventor, there were some bugs and troubles in it, making it not work, and through time and hard work, I finally found out what the problemw as in the code and quickly fixed it, continuing on with my project. C.S is something that is quite complicated, something that people may not get at first, yet they will slowly through hard work and determination. I believe myself as one of these people, people that donâ€™t give up even when there are hard times, people that keep pushing through until they finish their work. I would like to thank you for your time, and please do check out the rest of my site.</p>
