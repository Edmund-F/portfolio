              <p class="card-title">The Scratch Project me and my partner made is a platformer game with a total of 4 levels in it, in which you must work together with your teammate in order to get into the portal and pass the level. In this particular project, i learned how to code more fluently with scratch, along with making basic things in scratch like a movement code, or a "gravity" variable. Challenges I overcame was when the game we made broke, and we ended up spending quite a long time trying to fix the game itself. My partner and I both work quite hard in order to solve this problem, and finally finished it after trying out many different variables. This project was made around September 7-15.   </p>

              <p class="card-text">The Project that me and my partner created is called "Paint-pot-2.0." UNlike the normal paintpot there is, our paintpot is more creative and fun to play, with additional things added onto it, like extra colors, or the ability to take pictures and then color it. You can also choose between clearing the picture, or only the colors themself. From this specific project, I learned how to add onto another pre-made projects, but add enough changes in it to make it seem much different. I also figured out how to code more properly with MIT app inventor. I overcame many problems that lay in our path when we couldn't find out what to code, and in the end finally finished it by going on the internet along with my partner. This project was made around sept. 10 to sept-25. </p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Bootstrap</h5>
              <p class="card-text">This Project is making a website completely out of HTML, nothing else. We made up a Online Portfolio with this, and you are currently on it. I learned how to use bootstrap to make websites in this project, along with the variables required, and their uses here and there. There were many problems with teh website at first, but after a while, coding using bootstrap started getting easier, and I slowly finished the layout of the website. This project was made around November 7th, till now.  </p>

              <p class="card-text"> This one project required us to create a code out of python that would manipulate an image, either by changing the color, adding something onto it, or making borders for it. There were some complcations at first, but after a while of work, we were able to finish and work out the imperfections. This little project was made around Feburary 25th. </p>
